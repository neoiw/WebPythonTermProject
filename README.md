# A Very Good Looking README.md
This is my Python project for WebPython class is the university.
Each students has to get some raw data from web and 'sort and analyze' the data in some way in Python.
I chose my Discord chats as my source of data, and I'll try to analyze who sent most messages images, etc.

[DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) is used to crawl the chat from Discord.
